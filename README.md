This repository contains all of my dotfiles to get vim, xquartz, .bash\_profile, .bashrc, etc.
up and running the way I like in a new environment.

Each of the files should have enough comments to figure out what is going on.

The vimcolors file is just a copy of the solarized vim colors in case something happens
to that site:
